      A page with some Google Maps V3 API samples
    </title> 
  <body> 
   These are some Google Maps API V3 samples that were created while working with the API:
   <ul>
    <li>
        <a href="map_events.html"> Map events demo </a> : lists all the events that can be triggered for the
        <code> google.maps.Map </code>  object and shows when that happens, by highlighting the event name.
    </li>
    <!-- <li>
        <a href="get_country.html"> Getting the country the map is centered on </a> 
    </li> -->
   </ul>
